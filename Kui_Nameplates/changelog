Since classic-5:
* enable aura timers (using LibClassicDurations)
* enable castbars (using LibClassicCasterino)
* use RealMobHealth if available

(also:)
* threat features can be enabled but currently rely on another addon embedding LibThreatClassic, such as DBM-Classic
- once LibThreatClassic is available, check "force tank mode" to enable health bar colouring


BETA NOTES

* yup, it's still a beta disguised as a normal release
* [classic] use libClassicCasterino to provide cast data

* this release should work on both classic and retail
- (on classic) there are likely to be some errors which I didn't find,
- various options are still visible for features which don't exist (auras, castbars, ...)
