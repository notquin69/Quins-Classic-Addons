# RCLootCouncil Classic v0.0.1

Below follows a list of missing, changed and removed features compared to [RCLootCouncil](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/rclootcouncil). I might have missed something, or maybe something doesn't work the way you'd like - in both cases, feel free to reach out either in [Curse](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/rclootcouncil-classic/) or on the [RCLootCouncil Discord](https://discord.gg/WfYhCx9).

This version is marked as release as the Twitch Client won't otherwise sync it, but treat it as a pre-release due to lack of proper testing.

## Missing

#### Proper Testing
Haven't done any real raid/instance testing as I probably won't be leveling that much.


## Changes
#### Versioning
In the version checker ("/rc v") the version of this module will show up. The Core RCLootCouncil version is shown when mousing over a player.

#### Master Loot
The options menu have been updated with settings of old regarding Master Looting.

#### Auto Pass
Updated for Classic. For now, Hunters and Shamans doesn't auto pass leather, and Warriors and Paladins doesn't auto pass mail. I haven't decided if it should stay this way, so let me now what you think.

#### Enchanting Level
I haven't found a good way to precisely get a candidate's Enchanting level, so for now it will be displayed as "< 300".


## Removed
#### Loot Status
Not used with Master Looting.

#### Personal Loot
Removed everything related to personal loot.

#### Azerite Armor
No longer an option in the "More Buttons" options.

#### Spec Icon
As there's no clear definition of a spec (nor really the need to have it) the spec icon option has been removed.

#### Role Column
There's no concept of roles in Classic, and no clear cut way of determining a candidate's role based on their talents, so I decided to remove it completely.
