What is VuhDo?

VuhDo is a raid monitor similar to CTRaidAssist or Blizzards built-in raid frames. Basically this is about displaying the health of raid members in form of clearly arranged bars. VuhDo is primarily directed to healing classes, but will make use to almost any other class. Moreover several healing spells or other actions can be asserted to mouse clicks on those bars (Click-Heal).

What VuhDo can do: 
1. Display all relevant informations about your raid members

- Player Tags (such as afk, disconnected, dead)

3. Set up the raid

> my efforts (and also interest) in maintaining and 
> developing WoW addons tends to zero, so I'll be
